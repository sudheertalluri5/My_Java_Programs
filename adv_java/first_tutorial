It is an API in java that is used to connect to DataBases

All the classes and interfaces related to JDBC are present in java.sql package.

We can use JBDC API to handle database using Java program and can perform the following activites:
1) Connect to the database
2) Execute queries and update statements to the database
3) Getting result received from the database table.
